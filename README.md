# docker-kafka

This is a very simple docker / docker-compose config to help you get a local instance of kafka running quickly.

## Version
You can tweak the version of kafka that needs to run in the docker-compose file, by adjusting the `version` argument. Presently it's defaulting to 2.7.0

## Running

`docker-compose up` should be all that's required.
